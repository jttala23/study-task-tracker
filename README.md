# Study Task Tracker (Flask)

## Purpose
A simple Flask web app that lets users add study tasks and mark them as done.

## How Generative AI Was Used
I used Generative AI to generate the initial Flask project structure (folders/files), routing plan, and starter HTML templates. I then customized the theme, pages, and styling.

## How to Run Locally
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
